## Sensor Simulation:
 - Simulate the behaviour of various sensors used in wildlife monitoring, such as camera traps, acoustic sensors, GPS trackers, and satellite imagery.
 - Emulate the data collection process, including sensor deployment, data transmission, and storage.

## Wildlife Behaviour Modeling:
 - Model the movement, behaviour, and interactions of different wildlife species.
 - Consider factors such as seasonal changes, migration patterns, and mating behaviours.
